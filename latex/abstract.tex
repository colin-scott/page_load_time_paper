A recent NSDI paper~\cite{flywheel} reported that
increasing the cache hit ratio for an HTTP proxy from 22\% to 32\% improved
median page load time (PLT) for mobile clients by less than 2\%.
We demonstrate two causes for this weak improvement:
objects on the critical path are often are not cached, and
slow processors on mobile devices cause computational delays to dominate network delays.

Both of
these factors were, in fact, outlined by a previous analysis of desktop
web performance~\cite{wang2013demystifying}. We argue for the need to highlight this prior
analysis. We also extend the analysis
to include mobile devices with slow CPUs, and reproduce the
HTTP proxy caching
results~\cite{flywheel} in a controlled environment. %, and observe comparable PLT reductions of 1\% in the median case.
In the extreme case of a perfect cache hit ratio, desktop page load times are
improved notably by 34\% compared to no caching, but mobile page
load times only improve by 13\% in the median case.
We develop a back-of-envelope performance model to help understand these effects.

% %In their NSDI paper~\cite{flywheel}, Google reported a counterintuitive result: increasing the cache hit ratio of their Flywheel HTTP proxy from 22\% to 32\% only improved median page load time for mobile clients by 1-2\%.
% Here, we seek to understand why improved caching had such a negligible effect on mobile performance.
% We reproduced these results in a controlled, mobile environment and observed
% comparable reductions of 1\% in the median case.
% Further, we show that with a perfect cache hit ratio, desktop page load times are improved notably by 34\% compared to no caching, but mobile page load times only improve by 13\% in the median case. Our contribution includes a model for predicting the estimated page load time for a given cache hit ratio.
% We further demonstrate that CPU speed is the key bottleneck preventing mobile devices from benefiting from web caching.
